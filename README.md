## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Portfolio: Combined Projects from Turing College

Welcome! This repository showcases four integrated projects developed during my studies at **Turing College**. Each project represents a progression in my machine learning journey, shaped by continuous feedback from a mentorship team composed of professionals from **Google, IBM, Meta**, and other leading tech companies.

Each project highlights a different aspect of my data science and machine learning skillset, including:

- ðŸ§¹ **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**
- ðŸ“Š **Exploratory Data Analysis & Statistical Modeling**
- ðŸ§  **Supervised Machine Learning**

Across the combined work, I use **Python**, where I implement a range of machine learning libraries (e.g.,**scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, etc.) to build and evaluate models, extract insights, and present results.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate not only technical proficiency, but also my ability to structure projects, communicate findings effectively, and apply machine learning to real-world problems.
